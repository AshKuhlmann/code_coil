# CodeCoil

A curated Python Q&A dataset.

## Data Entry GUI

A lightweight Python GUI application (`add_entry_gui.py`) is available to facilitate adding new Q&A entries to the repository. This tool automates ID generation, filename creation, and proper file placement based on the provided metadata.

To run the GUI:

```bash
python add_entry_gui.py
```

Fill in the required fields. The tool will automatically handle ID generation, filename creation, and placing the file in the correct directory (`content/domain/topic/subtopic/`).
