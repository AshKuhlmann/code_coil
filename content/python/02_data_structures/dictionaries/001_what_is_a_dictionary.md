# Question

What is a dictionary in Python?

# Answer

A dictionary (`dict`) is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map. Unlike other data types that hold only a single value as an element, a dictionary holds `key:value` pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable.
